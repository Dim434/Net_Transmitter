Lots of reorganization and initial test suite.

* Added test suite with nearly complete code coverage.
* Added FilterCollection, in turn allowing for the same filter to be applied more than once.
* Renamed all "Socket*Transmitter" classes to "Tcp*".
* Merged sendStream() into send().
* Removed redundant error variables in TcpServerConnection.
* Removed the TcpServerConnection::isServer() function (can't tell apart server and client).
